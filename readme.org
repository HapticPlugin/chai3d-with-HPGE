* HPGE: Haptic Plugin for Game Engines

This is the C/C++ library, based on CHAI3D, which can be used together with the
[[https://github.com/HapticPlugin/HPGE-wrappers][HPGE-wrappers]] to use haptic devices in Unity3D.

* Compile Instructions

** Linux

If you are on a Guix System, or on a debian derivate, you can use guix to build
the library

#+begin_src bash
# On debian-based only
sudo apt install guix
guix pull
# After
guix build -f guix.scm
#+end_src

Or you can install the dependencies and run
#+begin_src bash
meson build
ninja -C build
#+end_src

Dependencies are specified in the [[file:guix.scm][guix.scm]] file and should be:
- libusb
- eigen
- meson
- ninja
- pkg-config
- gcc
- ncurses5 (required for the phantom device only)

** Windows

You can run the script [[file:fetch_dependencies_win.sh]] under [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][git bash]].  It
requires a working Visual Studio installation.  If you have experience with
windows, please help me out fixing this paragraph!
